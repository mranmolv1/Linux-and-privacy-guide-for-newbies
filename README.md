This is a guide made for linux newbies. To make them comfortable with linux. You are free to open issue if you have any question regarding this topic.

### What is linux? 
Before installing linux it is always good to know what linux is. If you are not interested in about it you can skip this part.

Linux is the [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)). The linux operating system which we usually use is comprised of [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU)+[LINUX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)).
So basically Linux is the kernel whereas the GNU is the extensive collection of free software and thats why many people call it (GNU+LINUX). Here is the link to the copypasta which many people use in linux forums and linux community - https://paste.rs/k0F


#### Linux Distributions 
[Linux Distibution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) or linux distros are different operating systems with different collections of
software / [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) / [desktop environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment)(which we will cover in the next topic) but all linux distributions have one thing in common. They <strong>use the same [linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)). </strong>. There are many linux distros out there but the ones I recommend are - 

* [Linuxmint](https://linuxmint.com/) - Linux mint was my first linux distro :) I highly recommend you to use this one.
* [Kde neon](https://neon.kde.org/)
* [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/) - Just [ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) with Kde desktop environment. See the [Desktop environment](https://github.com/prorounak2005/Newbies-Guide-to-linux/blob/main/README.md#desktop-environments) article.

#### Desktop environments
[Desktop environemnts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment) are graphical user interfaces with their own set of apps (like notepad,calculator file managers). There are many desktop environments in linux, different desktop environment have different [GUIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) they also have a different look and feel. 

There are many desktop environments in linux and the most popular ones are - 

* [Kde Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/)  {Kde is an international free software community and they made the plasma Desktop environment}
* [Cinnamon](https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=292) 
* [Gnome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME)
* [Xfce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce)

## Installing linux operating system 
Installing linux operating system is very easy and not that complicated. Many people say that most of the stuff doesn't work on linux, thats really not true but yeah some stuff (like some games, some video editing software) doesn't work on linux. Don't worry because I am going to give you some [free and open source alternatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) to the [proprietary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) video editors you often use in windows and trust me these video editors are lot better than the video editors you used in windows. We will discuss it in details in this topic. Nowadays many games like ( Rust, Apex legends, csgo) specially the steam games runs on linux. Many big companies like [Valve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation) , [Code Weavers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CodeWeavers) have made tremendous changes over the past few months, allowing Linux to truly become a viable platform for gaming. Further, more and more indie development teams strive to use cross-platform rendering engines in order to have their game able to compile and run on Linux. You can go to [Proton db](https://www.protondb.com/) to see which games can run on linux.

### Installing a distribution
First thing you want to do is to choose a linux distribution. Don't worry, installation steps will be same for all linux distributions. In this case I am going to use [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) you can use other distribtions if you like.
