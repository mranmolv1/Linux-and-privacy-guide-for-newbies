Linux is the [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)). The linux operating system which we usually use is comprised of [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU)+[LINUX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)).
So basically Linux is the kernel whereas the GNU is the extensive collection of free software and thats why many people call it (GNU+LINUX). Here is the link to the copypasta which many people use in linux forums and linux community - https://paste.rs/k0F


#### Linux Distributions 
[Linux Distibution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) or linux distros are different operating systems with different collections of
software /[package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) / [desktop environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment)(which we will cover in the next topic) but all linux distributions have one thing in common. They <strong>use the same [linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)). </strong>. There are many linux distros out there but the ones I recommend are - 

* [Linuxmint](https://linuxmint.com/) - Linux mint was my first linux distro :) I highly recommend you to use this one.
* [Kde neon](https://neon.kde.org/)
* [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/) - Just [ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) with Kde desktop environment. See the Desktop environment article.

#### Desktop environments
[Desktop environemnts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment) are graphical user interfaces with their own set of apps (like notepad,calculator file managers). There are many desktop environments in linux, different desktop environment have different [GUIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) they also have a different look and feel. 

There are many desktop environments in linux and the most popular ones are - 

* [Kde Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/)  {Kde is an international free software community and they made the plasma Desktop environment}
* [Cinnamon](https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=292) 
* [Xfce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce)
